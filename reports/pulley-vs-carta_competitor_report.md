## Methodology & Data Notes

- **Data source:** Active job postings from Indeed, company Greenhouse ATS boards, and fractional job boards
- **Scraping cadence:** Weekly
- **Total database size:** 99,142 active postings across all companies
- **Company matching:** Fuzzy match on normalized company name
- **Salary data:** Only includes roles with explicitly posted compensation. Many companies do not disclose salary ranges, so compensation data may not represent the full picture.
- **Hiring signals:** Algorithmically extracted from job descriptions. "Growth Hire" = language indicating team expansion. "Turnaround" = language indicating role restructuring or performance issues. "Immediate" = urgent fill indicators.
- **Team structure signals:** Extracted from reporting relationships and team-building language in descriptions.
- **Limitations:** Data sources include Indeed and Greenhouse ATS boards. Roles posted exclusively on LinkedIn or other job boards may not appear. Data reflects postings, not confirmed hires.
